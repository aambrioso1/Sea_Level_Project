# Sea Level Project
A project for collect sea level data using the CO-OPS API from the NOAA Tides and Currents webpage.

## Introduction
This is the CO-OPS API website:
- https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/#requestResponse

We will use the API to gather data from about ten ports throughout the United States for sea level.
The data should go back as many years as possible.   We will use basic statistics to see whether
sea levels are rising.

Python files available in the library
-------------------------------------
- Old code for collecting temperature data: noaa_json.py and noaa_test.py
- This is the main project code:  alex/Sea_Level_Project/sea_level.py

## Things to do
- Figure how far back the data goes, what units are used, and how frequently it is collected.
- Decide how to store the data (csv, JSON, dataframe, or something else).
- Complete the collection, and work out analyzing and graphing the data, for a single port.
- Pick about 10 ports throughout the US (Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic) to collect more data from.
- Prepare a presentation of the findings include displaying it on my website.

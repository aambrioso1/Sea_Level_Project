# Sea_Level_Project
A project for collect sea level data from using the CO-OPS API from the NOAA Tides and Currents webpage.

This is the API website:  https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/#requestResponse

We will use the API to gather data from about ten ports throughout the United States for sea level.
The data should go back as many years as possible.   We will use basic statistics to see whether
sea levels are rising.

This programs are relavant to the project:

https://github.com/aambrioso1/HCC-Programming-Project/blob/master/noaa_json.py

These were so programs I used in the past to collect temperature data from local (Florida) ports.

# Sea_Level_Project
A project for collect sea level data from using the CO-OPS API from the NOAA Tides and Currents webpage.

This is the API website:
- https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/#requestResponse

We will use the API to gather data from about ten ports throughout the United States for sea level.
The data should go back as many years as possible.   We will use basic statistics to see whether
sea levels are rising.

This programs are relevant to the project:
- https://github.com/aambrioso1/HCC-Programming-Project/blob/master/noaa_test.py
- https://github.com/aambrioso1/HCC-Programming-Project/blob/master/noaa_json.py

These are programs I used in the past to collect temperature data from local (Florida) ports.

# Things to do
- Figure out how to use the API to collect sea level data.
- Figure how far back the data goes, what units are used, and how frequently it is collected.
- Decide how to store the data (csv, JSON, dataframe, or something else).
- Pick about 10 ports throughout the US (Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic) to collect data from.
- Write a program to collect and store data.
- Write a program to analyze the data.
- Prepare a presentation of the findings include a displaying it on my website.
